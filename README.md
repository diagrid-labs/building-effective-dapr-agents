# Building Effective Dapr Agents

This repository demonstrates implementations of agent patterns based on Anthropic's research paper [Building Effective Agents](https://www.anthropic.com/research/building-effective-agents). The paper emphasizes that successful agent implementations use simple, composable patterns rather than complex frameworks.

These examples showcase how to implement these patterns using the [Dapr Agents framework](https://dapr.github.io/dapr-agents/), which provides a clean workflow approach to building agent systems.

## Why Dapr for Agents?

Dapr brings unique advantages to agent implementation:

- **Workflow Orchestration**: Durable, reliable execution of complex agent tasks
- **Pub/Sub Messaging**: Event-driven communication between agent components
- **State Management**: Built-in persistence with pluggable state stores
- **LLM Abstraction**: Reliably and observable interactions with LLMs
- **Platform Agnostic**: Runs locally or on any cloud platform

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- Docker
- [Dapr CLI](https://docs.dapr.io/getting-started/install-dapr-cli/)

## 1. Augmented LLM Pattern

### Pattern Overview

The Augmented LLM pattern is a foundational building block for agentic systems. It enhances a language model with external capabilities such as memory, tools, and retrieval systems. This pattern enables LLMs to overcome their inherent limitations by connecting them to the outside world, allowing them to remember context across interactions and access external data or services.

![01_augmented_llm.webp](images/01_augmented_llm.webp)

### Use Cases

- **Personal Assistants**: Remembering user preferences and accessing calendars, emails, or other personal data
- **Customer Support**: Retrieving product information or account details to provide accurate assistance
- **Research Tools**: Searching and retrieving information from databases or knowledge bases
- **Domain-Specific Applications**: Connecting to specialized tools like calculators, data analyzers, or external APIs

### Implementation

This example demonstrates a simple travel planning assistant that:
1. Remembers user context (desired travel destination)
2. Uses a tool to search for flight options to that destination

[Source code: 01_augmented_llm.py](01_augmented_llm.py)

Run the example:

```bash
python 01_augmented_llm.py
```

### How It Works

The key components of this implementation are:

1. **Memory**: The agent automatically maintains conversation history, allowing it to remember that the user wants to visit Paris.

2. **Tool Integration**: A flight search tool is defined using the `@tool` decorator, which automatically handles:
    - Input validation with Pydantic models
    - Type conversion
    - Structured output formatting

3. **Agent Configuration**: The agent is configured with:
    - A specific role ("Travel Planner Assistant")
    - Instructions that guide its behavior
    - Access to the defined tools

When the user asks for flights without specifying a destination in the second interaction, the agent:
- Recalls the previously mentioned destination (Paris) from memory
- Invokes the flight search tool with "Paris" as the parameter
- Presents the flight options in a natural, conversational format

## 2. Stateful LLM Pattern

### Pattern Overview

> **Note:** This is not one of the Anthropic paper patterns, but it demonstrates how easy it is to turn the stateless pattern from the previous example into a durable one (by swapping Agent to AssistantAgent) and running it with a Dapr sidecar to get all the Dapr benefits. For the rest of the examples, we will use the sidecar approach to run the examples.

The Stateful LLM pattern extends the Augmented LLM pattern by adding persistence, reliability, and workflow capabilities. This pattern enables LLMs to maintain state across sessions and handle long-running operations that can survive system restarts.

![02_stateful_llm.png](images/02_stateful_llm.png)

### Use Cases

- **Mission-Critical Applications**: Where reliability and fault tolerance are essential
- **Long-Running Tasks**: Operations that may take minutes, hours, or days to complete
- **Distributed Systems**: Applications running across multiple services or regions
- **Customer Support**: Handling complex multi-session support tickets that might span days
- **Business Processes**: Implementing business workflows with LLM intelligence at each step
- **Complaint Resolution**: Managing multi-stage resolution processes that require different departments

### Implementation

This example demonstrates a stateful travel planning assistant that:
1. Remembers user context persistently (across restarts)
2. Uses a tool to search for flight options
3. Exposes a REST API for workflow interaction
4. Stores execution state in Dapr workflow state stores

[Source code: 02_stateful_llm.py](02_stateful_llm.py)

Run the example:

```bash
dapr run --app-id stateful-llm --app-port 8001 --dapr-http-port 3500 --resources-path components/ -- python 02_stateful_llm.py
```

### Interacting with the Agent

Unlike the simple agent in example 01, this stateful agent exposes a REST API for workflow interactions:

#### Start a new workflow:

```bash
curl -i -X POST http://localhost:8001/start-workflow \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"task": "I want to find flights to Paris"}'
```

You'll receive a workflow ID in response, which you can use to track progress.

#### Check workflow status:

```bash
# Replace WORKFLOW_ID with the ID from the previous response
curl -i -X GET http://localhost:3500/v1.0/workflows/durableTaskHub/WORKFLOW_ID
```

### How It Works

The key components of this implementation are:

1. **Persistent Memory**: The agent stores conversation state in Dapr's state store, enabling it to remember context across sessions and system restarts.

2. **Workflow Orchestration**: Long-running tasks are managed through Dapr's workflow system, providing:
    - Durability - workflows survive process crashes
    - Observability - track status and progress
    - Recoverability - automatic retry on failures

3. **Tool Integration**: A flight search tool is defined using the `@tool` decorator, which automatically handles input validation and type conversion.

4. **Service Exposure**: The agent exposes REST endpoints to start and manage workflows.

### Key Differences from Augmented LLM Pattern

- **Persistence**: State survives across restarts, unlike the in-memory state of basic agents
- **Reliability**: Automatic failure recovery and retry mechanisms
- **API Access**: REST endpoints for workflow management
- **Observability**: Ability to track and monitor workflow progress
- **Durability**: Can handle long-running tasks spanning minutes, hours, or days

## 3. Prompt Chaining Pattern

### Pattern Overview

The Prompt Chaining pattern decomposes a complex task into a sequence of steps, where each LLM call processes the output of the previous one. This pattern allows for breaking down complex tasks into simpler, more manageable steps with validation gates between them.

![Prompt Chaining Pattern](images/03_chaining.webp)

### Use Cases

- **Content Generation**: Creating outlines first, then expanding to full documents
- **Multi-stage Analysis**: Breaking complex analysis into sequential steps
- **Quality Assurance Workflows**: Adding validation between processing steps
- **Translation Services**: First understanding content, then translating with context
- **Planning Systems**: Creating high-level plans before detailed implementation

### Implementation

This example demonstrates a travel planning workflow that:
1. Extracts the destination from user input (using simple prompt)
2. Validates the destination with a gate function
3. Generates a travel outline (using agent with tools)
4. Expands the outline into a detailed itinerary (using agent without tools)

The implementation showcases three different approaches to task execution:
- Basic prompt-based task (no agent)
- Agent-based task with tools
- Agent-based task without tools

[Source code: 03_chaining.py](03_chaining.py)

Run the example:

```bash
dapr run --app-id prompt-chaining --resources-path components/ -- python 03_chaining.py
```

### How It Works

The key components of this implementation are:

1. **Sequential Tasks**: The workflow chains multiple LLM operations together, with each building on the previous step's output.

2. **Validation Gate**: A simple check ensures the extracted destination is valid before proceeding to more complex (and costly) operations.

3. **Multiple Execution Types**:
    - Simple prompt (destination extraction): Uses a basic prompt without an agent
    - Planning agent (outline creation): Uses an agent with tools for attraction search
    - Itinerary agent (detail expansion): Uses an agent without tools for creative content generation

4. **Tool Integration**: The planning agent uses a tool to search for attractions based on type.

### When to Use This Pattern

This pattern is ideal when:
- Tasks can be naturally decomposed into sequential steps
- Each step builds on the output of the previous step
- You need validation between processing steps
- You're willing to trade some latency for higher quality results

## 4. Routing Pattern

### Pattern Overview

The Routing pattern classifies an input and directs it to a specialized followup task. This pattern enables separation of concerns, allowing each specialized handler to focus on a specific type of input without the complexity of handling all possible cases.

![Routing Pattern](images/04_routing.webp)

### Use Cases

- **Customer Support**: Directing different types of queries (refunds, technical help, general questions) to specialized agents
- **Content Creation**: Routing writing tasks to topic specialists (finance, tech, healthcare)
- **Resource Optimization**: Sending simple queries to smaller, faster models and complex ones to more capable models
- **Multi-lingual Support**: Routing queries to language-specific handlers
- **Hybrid LLM Systems**: Using different models for different tasks based on their strengths

### Implementation

This example demonstrates a travel assistant that:
1. Takes a user's travel query as input
2. Classifies the query into one of three categories:
    - Attractions (sightseeing, activities)
    - Accommodations (hotels, rentals)
    - Transportation (getting around, travel logistics)
3. Routes the query to a specialized handler optimized for that category
4. Returns a detailed response from the appropriate specialist

[Source code: 04_routing.py](04_routing.py)

Run the example:

```bash
dapr run --app-id routing --resources-path components/ -- python 04_routing.py
```

### How It Works

The key components of this implementation are:

1. **Query Classification**: An LLM-based router analyzes the input query and determines its category using a structured output format (RoutingDecision).

2. **Specialized Handlers**: Three task handlers with optimized prompts focus on different travel domains:
    - Attractions handler: Optimized for questions about sights and activities
    - Accommodations handler: Specialized for hotel and lodging inquiries
    - Transportation handler: Focused on travel logistics questions

3. **Workflow Orchestration**: The Dapr workflow engine manages the process flow:
    - First sending the query to the classifier
    - Then routing to the appropriate specialized handler
    - Finally returning the response to the user

### When to Use This Pattern

This pattern is ideal when:
- Tasks involve distinct categories that are better handled separately
- Classification can be done accurately by an LLM
- Different types of inputs benefit from specialized prompts
- You want to optimize cost/performance by routing simpler queries to smaller models

## 5. Parallelization Pattern

### Pattern Overview

The Parallelization pattern allows LLMs to work simultaneously on different aspects of a task, with outputs aggregated programmatically. 

![Parallelization Pattern](images/05_parallelization.webp)

### Use Cases

- **Complex Research**: Processing different aspects of a research topic simultaneously
- **Content Creation**: Generating multiple sections of a document in parallel
- **Decision Making**: Collecting multiple perspectives on the same problem (voting)
- **Multi-faceted Planning**: Creating various elements of a plan concurrently
- **Product Analysis**: Analyzing different aspects of a product in parallel

### Implementation

This example demonstrates a travel planning workflow that:
1. Takes a user's travel request as input
2. Processes three aspects in parallel:
   - Attractions research
   - Accommodation recommendations
   - Transportation options
3. Aggregates the results into a comprehensive travel plan

[Source code: 05_parallelization.py](05_parallelization.py)

Run the example:

```bash
dapr run --app-id parallelization --resources-path components/ -- python 05_parallelization.py
```

### How It Works

The key components of this implementation are:

1. **Parallel Task Definition**: Three independent LLM tasks are defined to process different aspects of the travel planning problem.

2. **Workflow Orchestration**: The Dapr workflow engine coordinates the parallel execution of these tasks, handling synchronization and aggregation.

3. **Result Aggregation**: Once all parallel tasks complete, their outputs are combined into a comprehensive travel plan by a final LLM call.

This implementation demonstrates the core value of the Parallelization pattern: improved efficiency through concurrent processing of independent subtasks, with programmatic aggregation of results.

### When to Use This Pattern

This pattern is ideal when:
- Tasks can be divided into independent subtasks
- You need to process multiple aspects of a problem simultaneously
- Speed is important, and parallelization can reduce overall latency
- You want multiple perspectives on the same problem (voting variation)

## 6. Orchestrator-Workers Pattern

### Pattern Overview

The Orchestrator-Workers pattern features a central orchestrator LLM that dynamically breaks down tasks, delegates them to worker LLMs, and synthesizes their results.

![Orchestrator-Workers Pattern](images/06_orchestrator.webp)

### Use Cases

- **Complex Travel Planning**: Creating comprehensive travel itineraries with multiple components
- **Software Development**: Making changes across multiple files based on requirements
- **Research Tasks**: Gathering and analyzing information from multiple sources
- **Business Analysis**: Evaluating different facets of a complex problem
- **Content Creation**: Combining specialized content from various domains

### Implementation

This example demonstrates a travel planning workflow that:
1. Takes a complex travel request as input
2. Uses an orchestrator LLM to analyze the request and determine required subtasks
3. Dispatches each subtask to worker LLMs that handle specific aspects of the travel plan
4. Uses a synthesizer LLM to combine all worker outputs into a comprehensive travel plan

[Source code: 06_orchestrator.py](06_orchestrator.py)

Run the example:

```bash
dapr run --app-id orchestrator --resources-path components/ -- python 06_orchestrator.py
```

### How It Works

The key components of this implementation are:

1. **Dynamic Task Planning**: An orchestrator LLM analyzes the input and dynamically creates a plan of subtasks, each defined with a clear objective.

2. **Specialized Workers**: Each subtask is assigned to a worker LLM that focuses on solving just that specific aspect of the problem.

3. **Result Synthesis**: Once all workers complete their tasks, their outputs are combined by a synthesizer LLM into a cohesive final result.

4. **Flexible Architecture**: Unlike patterns with fixed workflows, this pattern adapts to each input by creating custom task plans.

This implementation demonstrates the core value of the Orchestrator-Workers pattern: handling complex, open-ended problems by dynamically creating and executing subtask plans.

### When to Use This Pattern

This pattern is ideal when:
- Tasks are complex and can't be broken into predefined subtasks
- The number and nature of subtasks depend on the specific input
- Specialized handling is needed for different aspects of a problem
- Results need to be synthesized into a cohesive output

### Key Differences from Parallelization

Unlike the parallelization pattern where subtasks are predefined, the orchestrator-workers pattern:
- Dynamically determines what subtasks are needed
- Provides flexibility to handle a wide range of inputs
- Can create varying numbers and types of subtasks based on the specific request

## 7. Evaluator-Optimizer Pattern

### Pattern Overview

The Evaluator-Optimizer pattern features two complementary LLM roles in a feedback loop: one generates content while another evaluates it, leading to iterative improvements until quality criteria are met.

![Evaluator-Optimizer Pattern](images/07_evaluator.webp)

### Use Cases

- **Content Creation**: Refining written content to match specific style guidelines or quality standards
- **Translation**: Improving literary translations that require nuanced understanding and expression
- **Code Generation**: Creating code that meets specific requirements and handles edge cases
- **Complex Search**: Multi-round information gathering and refinement

### Implementation

This example demonstrates a simple travel planning workflow that:
1. Takes a weekend trip request as input
2. Uses a generator LLM to create an initial travel plan
3. Uses an evaluator LLM to assess the plan and provide feedback
4. Improves the plan based on evaluation feedback
5. Terminates after feedback is incorporated or reaches maximum iterations

[Source code: 07_evaluator.py](07_evaluator.py)

Run the example:

```bash
dapr run --app-id evaluator-optimizer --resources-path components/ -- python 07_evaluator.py
```

### How It Works

The key components of this implementation are:

1. **Generator LLM**: Creates or refines a travel plan based on user request and feedback
2. **Evaluator LLM**: Scores the plan and provides structured feedback for improvement
3. **Feedback Loop**: Enables a simple round of generation and evaluation
4. **Quality Criteria**: Checks if the plan meets requirements or needs further refinement

The implementation demonstrates how multiple LLMs can work together in a feedback loop to improve content quality - in this case, a simple weekend trip to San Francisco.

### When to Use This Pattern

This pattern is ideal when:
- There are clear evaluation criteria for the generated content
- Iterative refinement improves output quality
- LLM responses can be improved through explicit feedback
 

## 8. Autonomous Agent Pattern

### Pattern Overview

The Autonomous Agent pattern features an LLM that dynamically directs its own processes and tool usage, maintaining control over how it accomplishes tasks through an iterative reasoning-action-observation loop.

![Autonomous Agent Pattern](images/08_agent.webp)

### Use Cases

- **Research Assistant**: Finding and synthesizing information from multiple sources
- **Customer Support**: Resolving complex issues through information gathering and problem-solving
- **Software Development**: Debugging and fixing issues across codebases
- **Personal Assistant**: Handling scheduling, reminders, and information lookup tasks

### Implementation

This example demonstrates a simple travel assistant that:
1. Takes a travel query as input
2. Uses the ReAct (Reasoning-Action) framework to determine what information is needed
3. Dynamically decides which tools to call and in what order
4. Synthesizes gathered information into a comprehensive response

[Source code: 08_agent.py](08_agent.py)

Run the example:

```bash
dapr run --app-id agent --resources-path components/ -- python 08_agent.py
```

### How It Works

The key components of this implementation are:

1. **ReAct Framework**: The agent follows a structured [Reasoning-Action-Observation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629) loop:
    - **Thought**: The agent reasons about what information is needed
    - **Action**: The agent calls a tool to gather information
    - **Observation**: The agent processes the tool's response
    - **Repeat**: The cycle continues until sufficient information is gathered

2. **Tool Integration**: The agent has access to simple tools:
    - Weather information for cities
    - Activity recommendations for popular destinations

3. **Self-Directed Process**: Unlike other patterns, the agent itself decides:
    - Which tools to use
    - In what order to call them
    - When it has sufficient information to respond

This implementation demonstrates the core value of the Autonomous Agent pattern: enabling dynamic, adaptive problem-solving without predefined workflows.

### When to Use This Pattern

This pattern is ideal when:
- Tasks require sequentially dependent steps
- Tool usage decisions depend on previous observations
- The workflow can't be predetermined
- Human intervention should be minimized
- Adaptability to changing circumstances is required
